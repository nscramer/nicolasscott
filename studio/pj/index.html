      <h2>Mold yourself into the person you want to be</h2>
      <p>My training programs are for those of us who want to be more fit, feel better, and push ourselves further.</p>
      <p>Is that you? Are you up for a challenge?</p>
      <p>You’re reading this because you get it. You realize how important physical mastery is to other aspects of your life: sharper thinking, more discipline, greater confidence, better relationships. Staying fit gives you an edge.</p>
      <p>That's why I create <strong>programs, not workouts</strong>&mdash;because getting that edge only comes from succeeding at a plan made just for you. Workouts are things you tear out of a magazine, save on Pinterest, that anyone uses. You don't need me if you're just looking for a workout to do. Seriously, grab a copy of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-Basic-Barbell-Training/dp/0982522738/">Starting Strength</a> and a gym membership.</p>
      <p>My programs are personalized: tailored to your goals, your schedule, your abilities, and your lifestyle. My photographer friends like to say the best camera is the one you have with you. And I've found that <strong>the best fitness program is the one you can stick with</strong>.</p>
      <p>Let me show you.</p>

      <h2>Train with what works</h2>
      <p>My purpose is to get you fit as hell, not to push some workout ideology on you. I don't train meatheads. I don't do Jane Fonda bullshit either. Instead I evolve my modern fitness systems based on empirical data and kinesiological research.</p>
      <p>They combine classic strength and conditioning (barbells, dumbbells, exercise bike) with functional work (kettlebells, resistance bands, slide boards).</p>
      <p>Want to lose weight? Want to pick up some muscle? Want to look better in the mirror? It all goes into the formula. Your program will be comprehensive health, fitness, and strength you can use. And it's the best way to reach your goals.</p>
      <p>Using these components, I design a program for you. With any of my programs though, what works is what works, so you're guaranteed to see a few things:</p>

      <h2>Two options to fit any lifestyle and location</h2>
      <p>No matter where in the world you find yourself, there's a training structure for you. If you're fortunate enough to live in the great city of Cincinnati you can come train with me personally. And if not, or if you're a frequent traveler, my mobile coaching is a flexible, no-excuses way to better yourself physically.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A 45 minute in-person training session. Our Cincinnati warehouse facility has all the gear, weights, and tools we need and none of the frills we don't. Train solo, or bring a friend with similar goals and get trained as a unit.</p>
        <p>It's not cheap. But that's because it's the most intensive, detailed, supervised and hands on coaching experience possible. And it creates the accountability that gets your ass out of bed and here to train.</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>“I started working with PJ two years ago because I knew the accountability of having a training session on the calendar was the best way to get me into the gym, and <strong>his expertise meant I could let go and trust the process</strong>. I don't need more cognitive overhead. Instead I show up, do what he says, work my ass off, and leave knowing that no matter how other projects go, I achieved something that day.”</p>

        <p><strong>The most popular option</strong>. Get results on your schedule, with the expertise, accountability, and safety of a certified trainer.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works: We talk through your goals, history, circumstances, wants, and needs. Then I develop a physical training and nutrition plan to get the job done. You, from any gym, in any city, at any time, go put in the hard work. I'm always available for questions. You send me your results at the end of the week.   Bi-weekly progress check-ins keep us accountable. And together, we identify what's working, adjust, and grow.</p>

PJ created customized, measurable and efficient workouts geared specifically towards me and my goals, <strong>making an impact that I didn't think was possible or attainable</strong>: squatting, bench pressing and deadlifting over 300 lbs. for multiple repetitions, doing sets of 15 rep pull-ups, and taking my body fat to a level which turns heads on the beach.”</p>

      <h2>Change begins with a single email</h2>
      <p>Think about the times you’ve told yourself you’re going to get more fit, the times you told yourself you're going to get in better shape, look better, feel better. Now’s your chance. Not on the 1st, not next Monday. Today,<span>
      <script>
      var d=new Date()

      document.write(weekday[d.getDay()])
      </script></span>. Tell me how I can help.</p>
      <p><strong>I’m taking on a few new clients for 2017</strong>. Because I create everything myself and I won’t sacrifice quality, I can't work with everyone. But if you're ready to commit to discipline, diligence, and achievement, then I'd love to hear from you.</p>
      <p>I've been doing this a long time. Thinking back on my own journey with fitness, from my first lifts until now, it's clear I'm a better man because of it. I owe whatever success I've had to the trainers and coaches and gyms that showed me the way. Now it's my turn to show you just how much you're capable of.</p>
